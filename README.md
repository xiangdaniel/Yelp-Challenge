# Feature-Based Yelp Recommendation System

We developed a restaurant recommendation
system for both users and visitors using Yelp Open Dataset. The Item-based Collaborative Filtering recommendation algorithm was implemented with Spark. We also researched Natural Language Processing and analyzed the reviews of users. Four features are extracted and their weights are calculated to facilitate users' understanding about the recommended restaurants. We finally created a web page to visualize results. If users log in their ids, they will get the information about the recommended restaurants based on their previous preference.
